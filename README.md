This is a short presentation showing steps to make bash aliases and functions to make terminal workflow easier along with a few exercises to test out these skills.

 1. [list Linux commands](1-linuxCommands.md)
 2. [bash alias](2-alias.md)
 3. [pipe and redirection](3-pipeAndRedirection.md) to chain functions together (cat, pipe, grep) and arrows for standard out
 4. [exit codes and conditionals](4-exitCodesAndConditionals.md) and/or/; with status code (chaining aliases together)
 5. [bash functions](5-function.md) creating functions with arguments
 6. [practical applications](6-practicalApplications.md) rebuilding SOA after changing branches
